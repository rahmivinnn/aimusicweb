# Sample Audio Files

This directory should contain the following audio files for the remix functionality:

1. `classic-drums.wav` - Drum samples and patterns
2. `synth-leads.wav` - Synthesizer lead sounds
3. `basslines.wav` - Bass instrument samples
4. `fx-transitions.wav` - Sound effects and transitions

## File Requirements

- Format: WAV files (44.1kHz, 16-bit)
- Duration: Recommended 2-10 seconds per sample
- Channels: Stereo (2 channels)

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have the sample files, the application will use a fallback sine wave tone. To fully utilize the remix functionality, please add appropriate audio samples to this directory.

## Getting Sample Files

You can obtain sample files from:
1. Royalty-free music websites
2. Your own recordings
3. Sample pack marketplaces (ensure you have proper licenses)

Remember to rename the files exactly as listed above for the application to work properly.
